            <h4>1. Statement of the Problem</h4>
<b>Research Question</b>
	<div><head>How can high-schoolers begin to financially plan for their future using investment options and methods? What type of investments is the smartest for their future?</head></div>
               
<b>Research Classification</b>
 <div>I think that my research is equally quantitative as it is qualitative because in my research there are many examples that have numbers and statistics in them but also there is a lot of descriptive information that is important. Without the numbers or the descriptions, the research would be much less effective so I think my research is equally qualitative as it is quantitative. My first part of my project included interpreting research and understanding the definitions of methods which I consider qualitative data. The second part included understanding the implementation of the methods which can be considered quantitative. </div>
Rationale 	
I chose this topic because I have been interested in how to plan for your future financially and how to get started. Throughout my research for this project, I have learned a lot that I think everyone should learn and understand at a young age so that they can plan smart because it’s always better to start early than wait. I believe that school doesn’t teach kids enough about investing and money management.t, Another reason I chose this project was that I wanted to make a lot of money but I understood that it's more of money management than earning money. 
2. Statement of Problem
Financial Planning is one of the most important lessons that you can learn in life. It’s not how much you make, it's  how well you manage. Many factors come into play when deciding “wealth”. A good way to measure is by using the Wealth Formula which can be measured by Money + Time +/- Rate of Return - Inflation - Taxes. The Wealth Formula shows that money is just one factor, and if you don’t manage the other factors well, you won’t be “wealthy”. By understanding how one can financially plan for their future and understanding how to manage their money is one of the most important lessons that one can learn in modern society, especially where everything is connected to money.

Short-Term
Robert Farrington talks about some of the different methods there are for young investors for the short term.  It includes Online Checking/ Saving Accounts, Money Market Accounts, CDs, Short Term Bond Funds, TIPS, Floating Rate Funds, Selling Covered Calls, Paying off both Student Loan Debt as well as Peer-to-Peer Lending. Online Checking and Savings Accounts have higher interest rates, are short term, and are completely safe. Money Markets, on the other hand, are essentially the same thing but it’s just that they are not FDIC insured which means that they are slightly less safe, but they may have higher interest rates. They talked about CDs which we know about from past sources. They require you to store money for a set period which loses accessibility. The next best thing that they said were Short Term Bond Funds which are important to my question because they are directly from the government and they last for a shorter period which relates to my categories.  There is a very low risk, except for Corporate and Municipal Bonds. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities are another form of government bond that is important because they are bonds that adjust for inflation. It protects the price of a bond. Floating Rate Funds are risky great short-term bonds because they pay out good dividends, but they are risky, “take on debt to invest in other debt”.  Selling pre-owned stocks is another one they mentioned because of how other investors pay premiums for buying a stock you own at a given price. The last 3 strategies are not as important or as applicable because they are not investment strategies.

Long Term
	Long Term investing is very important because we all have to save for retirement and stay financially stable in times of emergencies and unexpected events. According to Joshua Kennon, a managing director at his own management firm that deals with hundreds or thousands of dollars, rapidly day-trading to get more money is a myth. Keeping yourself invested in stocks for a long time will get you more profits. The problem with rapidly day-trading is that there are usually very small profits that take more time and effort to get. The Buy and Hold Strategy is when an investor invests in common stocks and focuses more on total return and invests in the long term. “High-profile investors like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger have held onto stocks and businesses for 25+, even 50+ years to make the bulk of their money.” (Kennon)  An increase in share price is the result of the market valuing the increased profits. This is a fundamental topic that should be remembered because of the profits it can get you. An investor could have a custodial stock market trading account opened and invest in common stocks and forget about them for the next 4 years, and there is a good chance that they have made a profit according to this article. This can show in my question that stock market trading can be long term rather than short term.
Compounding
Albert Einstein once called Compound Interest “The Eighth Wonder of the World” because of how powerful it can be when applied properly. One of the best ways to start saving for our future is by planning for the long term because, in finance, it is always better to start early than wait longer. The money will grow exponentially once you start a foundation and contribute periodically. “Compounding makes a sum grow at a faster rate than simple interest because, in addition to earning returns on the money you invest, you also earn returns on those returns over time. It causes your wealth to snowball over time and means that you don’t have to save as much to reach your money goals” (Elkins). The Rule of 72 is a formula by which you can calculate in how many years your money will doubt by doing 72 / Rate of Return. 
IRAs
	IRAs can be very beneficial because of the purposes they can play in one’s life.  IRA stands for Individual Retirement Account and is meant to gradually build retirement savings over the years, so you don’t have to work until you die. There are many types of IRAs which include Traditional, Roth, SEP, and SIMPLE. “All IRAs offer tax benefits that reward you for saving”. (Yochim) Traditional and Roth IRAs are the most popular because they are opened by individuals. They allow you to save $6,000 per year and $7,000 when you reach 50. Traditional contributions may reduce a tax bill and Roth contributions are not tax-deductible. Another benefit of Roth IRAs is that they are Tax-Advantaged meaning that you don’t have to pay taxes on the harvest but only on the seed which can make a huge difference especially if your harvest is big. The SEP and SIMPLE IRAs apply to self-employed people. “There are no age restrictions. Kids of any age can contribute to a Roth IRA, as long as they have earned income.” This source, I believe, is relevant to my question because not only am I talking about short-term goals and priorities, but it is also important to think about the future and in this case maybe 40 years down the road when retirement is something that is set. This does relate in a way to my other sources because it is in relation to how I use and invest the profits from the short-term. 
Treasuries
A treasury is a way that the government raises money of which is used to run the federal government. These are considered “a safe and secure investment option because the full faith and credit of the U.S. government guarantee that interest and principal payments will be paid on time”. Bills are those with shorter terms that mature in one year or less. Notes and bonds pay a fixed rate of interest biannually, making them known as “fixed-interest securities”. Notes mature in 1-10 years while bonds mature after 10 years. (US Department of Treasury) There are also types of savings bonds which are long-term investments. The minimum amount to buy them is $100. This article is a great source of information for my research question because it clearly explains how one can start out in this process. It has information about both short-term (bills and some notes) and other longer-term investments (Some notes, bonds, and saving bonds). This is a basic but safe resource that many people decide to put their money in because it is better than 
letting our money sit in a bank and depreciate to inflation.
